-------->>>>>>>> There are three way to get the value of that parameter 
                    (i) innerHTML
                    (ii) ineerText
                    (iii) textContent


                - (i) innerHTML : 6 DOM/1 Details/4 innerHTML.png
                        in the innerHTML we get the entire values in which if we have write the HTML then that will also get as HTML    // for more understandind see the both png 
                
                - (ii) ineerText : 6 DOM/1 Details/4 innerText and textContent.png
                        in the ineerText we get the only things which we can see on the browser not the hiding or not like the ineerHTML.

                - (ii) textContent : 6 DOM/1 Details/4 innerText and textContent.png
                        in the textContent we get the things which we can see on the browser or if in that any content was written then it also select.
